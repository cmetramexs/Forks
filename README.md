### What it does
It is a game to encourage players to put their phones down during meal times, for example, to engage in a more meaningful conversations and spend quality time with family and friends. Any player who touches their phone will receive a penalty in points and a score board will show how players fared in the game session. Players can choose how they want to penalise the loser. We recommend having them treat everyone for that meal!

### How we built it
Our hardware uses ST7789, ESP32, and a LDR. We also design and laser cut the box ourselves with some inspiration from a game called "Portal"

Our software uses Java and C++ programming language using Android App Studio and Arduino IDE. We also use Adobe Illustrator for the logos and images.
